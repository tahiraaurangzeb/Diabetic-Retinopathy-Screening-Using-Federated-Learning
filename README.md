Our project enables early detection of diabetic retinopathy while fully preserving patient data privacy through federated learning.
It empowers hospitals and clinics to collaborate securely without sharing sensitive medical records, ensuring better eye care for all.
This project utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for diabetic retinopathy detection while preserving patient confidentiality through **Federated Learning (FL).**
By enabling decentralized model training across institutions, we ensure data privacy, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and support secure, collaborative healthcare innovation.
